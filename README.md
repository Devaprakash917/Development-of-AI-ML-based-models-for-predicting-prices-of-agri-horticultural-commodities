This project develops an AI-ML powered system to forecast prices of agri-horticultural commodities and recommend suitable crops based on environmental and market factors.

The system leverages machine learning and deep learning models to analyze historical prices, weather data, soil conditions, and supply-demand trends to provide accurate price forecasts and actionable insights for farmers, traders, and policymakers.

Expected Outcomes:

Accurate commodity price forecasts

Smart crop recommendations

Real-time market monitoring

Improved profitability for farmers

Data-driven agricultural planning
